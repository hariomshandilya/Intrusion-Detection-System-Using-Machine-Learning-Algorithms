# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Problem Statement: The task is to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.  Introduction: Intrusion Detection System is a software application to detect network intrusion using various machine learning algorithms.IDS monitors a network or system for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users, including perhaps insider. The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between ‘bad connections’ (intrusion/attacks) and a ‘good (normal) connections’.  Attacks fall into four main categories: #DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood; #R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password; #U2R: unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various “buffer overflow” attacks; #probing: surveillance and another probing, e.g., port scanning.
